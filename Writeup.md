## Introduction:

# A link to your dataset

A description of your dataset (what the variables and observations
represent) A description of your motivation for studying this dataset
Basic summary statistics about your dataset

## Visualizations

# At least one plot showing the relationship between two quantitative variables in your dataset, along

with your interpretation. At least one plot showing the relationship
between a categorical and quantitative variable in your dataset, along
with your interpretation. Choose the variables and plot type that are
best adapted for showing an interesting relationship in your dataset.
Remember that you can modify the aesthetic properties of your plot to
communicate your point more effectively.

## Dataset manipulations

# At least one plot based on a dplyr manipulation of your dataset.

This could include adding a new column to the plot, filtering the values
in the plot, plotting the result of the “summarize” function, or
something else. The focus of this section should be: How can data
manipulations reveal a new insight into your dataset?

## Statistical analyses

# At least one correlation between two quantitative variables in your dataset, and your interpretation of the result.

At least one linear regression between two quantitative variables in
your dataset, and your interpretation of the result. At least one t-test
between a categorical and quantitative variable in your dataset, and
your interpretation of the result. These tests should relate to
interesting questions related to your dataset. The focus of this section
is: How can you use this dataset to draw conclusions about a larger
population?

## Conclusion:

# Your overarching conclusions from your analysis.
