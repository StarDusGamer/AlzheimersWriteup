## Visualizations

# At least one plot showing the relationship between two quantitative variables in your dataset, along

with your interpretation. At least one plot showing the relationship
between a categorical and quantitative variable in your dataset, along
with your interpretation. Choose the variables and plot type that are
best adapted for showing an interesting relationship in your dataset.
Remember that you can modify the aesthetic properties of your plot to
communicate your point more effectively.
